    "## Exoplanet Discovery\n",
    "For the past 25+ years, NASA has used ground- and space-based methods to [identify exoplanets](https://exoplanets.nasa.gov/exep/about/missions-instruments) (planets outside of our solar system). In the past ten years in particular, campaigns like Kepler, K2, and TESS have produced an explosion of results. To date, approximately 4,400 exoplanets have been identified, and over 3,000 potential exoplanet candidates have been discovered. In this notebook, we will use Holoviews and Panel together with Astropy to make a dashboard visualizing the discovery of confirmed and candidate exoplanets over the years. We'll also include a scatterplot in our dashboard that reveals details about the relationship between mass and radius of exoplanets, as well as controls to filter the data based on whether the planets could support life, and if so, if chemical rockets could be used to escape the planet."

    "## Converting coordinates\n",
    "Because our goal is to generate a map of the exoplanets and stars, we need a standardized coordinate system for all three of our dataframes. Here, we'll use the [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org/) package to perform coordinate transformations. The original datasets use an equatorial coordinate system, given by ``ra`` (right acension) and ``dec`` (declination), but the specific notation varies among the datasets, and equatorial coordinates are less commonly used to visualize space. We will convert to galactic coordinates, a spherical coordinate system centered at the sun. Points in the galactic coordinate system are represented by two values: longitude (abbreviated \"l\") and latitude (abbreviated \"b\").\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the Astropy ``SkyCoord`` function, we define two functions, ``eqtogalL`` and ``eqtogalB``, which convert equatorial coordinates to galactic coordinates. ``eqtogalL`` takes (``ra``, ``dec``) as an argument and produces the longitude ``l``, while ``eqtogalB`` takes (``ra``, ``dec``) and produces the latitude ``b``.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we were to use the entire ``stars`` dataframe, this program would run very slowly. Thus, we consider only the brightest stars (those with the G magnitude, abbreviated \"phot_g_mean_mag,\" over 11), and of those, we sample 10% using ``.sample(frac=0.1)``.\n",
    "\n",
    "After converting, we create new columns in each of our dataframes for latitude and longitude then cache the results. Note that the size of the datasets means that converting to galactic coordinates can take up to a minute or two. To speed up the process, you can sample a fraction of any of the dataframes."
